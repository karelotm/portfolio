2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail recommended)
4. Connect your Gmail account (karim00el@gmail.com)
5. Note down the **Service ID** (e.g., `service_abc123`)

## Step 3: Create Email Template

1. Go to "Email Templates"
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template content:

```
Subject: New Contact Form Message from {{from_name}}

From: {{from_name}} ({{from_email}})
Subject: {{subject}}

{{message}}

---
This message was sent from your portfolio contact form.
```

4. Save the template and note down the **Template ID** (e.g., `template_xyz789`)

```

## Step 6: Test the Form

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"EmailJS is not defined" error**
   - Make sure the EmailJS script is loaded before your main.js
   - Check your internet connection

2. **"Service not found" error**
   - Verify your Service ID is correct
   - Make sure the service is active in your EmailJS dashboard

3. **"Template not found" error**
   - Verify your Template ID is correct
   - Make sure the template is published

4. **Emails not received**
   - Check your spam folder
   - Verify the email address in the template
   - Check EmailJS dashboard for error logs

### Free Plan Limits:

## Alternative: Netlify Forms (If using Netlify)

If you're hosting on Netlify, you can also use Netlify Forms:

1. Add `netlify` attribute to your form:
```html
<form class="space-y-4" novalidate netlify>
```

2. Remove EmailJS code and use Netlify's built-in form handling

## Alternative: Formspree

You can also use Formspree for form handling:

1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Update your form action:
```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

## Security Notes

- Never expose your EmailJS private keys in client-side code
- The public key is safe to use in frontend code
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use
- Always validate form data on the server side for production
